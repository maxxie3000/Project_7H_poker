# Projects on seven hand poker



First, tried to calculate probabilities but came out short (If someone reads this and can help me, please). Then, create simulations:
- create N random drawings for community cards. Shows the number of combinations with two known cards in hand (need to add appr. probabilities and stuff)

Possible project: Letting simple rule based bots (with different preferences) play against each other (Need some skill building for that...)
